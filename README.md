Yet Another Nomic-like Undertaking

## Roster

## Rules

- Only the text of this Rules section in this file, according to the most recent commit on the `main` branch according to https://github.com/nejucomo/yanu (and the common understanding am
ong players in the Roster section) determine the rules of the game.
- The only legitimate method of modifying these rules requires all of the following to be true:
  - The modification was applied by any of the github repository members clicking the "merge" button on a Github Pull Request.
  - At the time the Pull Request was merged, $\left \lceil \frac{R}{2} \right \rceil$ participants, where $R$ is the number of participants listed in the [Roster](#roster) have posted a review of the Pull Request and marked their review as "Approved", and the Github username matches a name in the [Roster](#roster).
- No one may click "Close" on any PR.
- Repository configuration settings may only be changed if there is clear consensus among all players in the [Roster](#roster).
